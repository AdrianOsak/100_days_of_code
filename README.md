## 24th day 05.06.2023

Today I was making this landing page, basicly from scratch. I used very little from my yesterday, but I finished managed to finish it anyway. I think it's supposed to be quick and easy but it took me almost whole day, but again, the most important thing to me is to practice everyday, so I'm glad I did it.
