Second task on freeCodeCamp.org was to make simple cafe menu. It contains image as background, main header, 2 headers with little icons below them and couple of items with prices and footer with address and e-mail address

## 3rd day 11.05.2023

Third day and third task on fCC. This time it was all about making 3 color markers and styling them in css to look more real. Main focus in this task was on colors, how to change their properties.

## 4th day 12.05.2023

Another assignment on fCC was to make registration form. Form had to contain couple inputs such as name, e-mail, password (which had some requirements), also radio-inputs, checkbox, select and textarea.

## 5th day 13.05.2023

Next task on fCC was to make survey form, this time it was without guidance. Today I made initial commit of this project with some html coded.

## 6th day 14.05.2023

First approach to style last project from fCC (survey form). Not done, not even halfway done.

## 7th day 15.05.2023

Further attempts to style survey form from fCC. Still not finished.

## 8th day 16.05.2023

Today I finished styling of survey form. It's not about looking extremely good and awesome, it's about being readable and clear, which I think it is.

## 9th day 17.05.2023

Today I made 2 simple tasks from fCC. First one was repetition of CSS box model (rothko_painting) and second was also repetition about CSS flexbox (flexbox_photo_gallery).

## 11th day 19.05.2023

Today's lesson from fCC was about accessiblity, I started to code some quiz with fCC guide. It's not done yet so I'll finish it next day.

## 12th day 20.05.2023

Finishing quiz from previous lesson.

## 13th day 21.05.2023

Today I started to code a tribute page for SAF, it's next assignment from fCC.

## 14th day 22.05.2023

Today I finished tribute site. It's simple site with not much content, but still I think that most important thing is to me code something every day to build a habit. Polishing projects will take place in future.
