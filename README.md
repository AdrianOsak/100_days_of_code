Second task on freeCodeCamp.org was to make simple cafe menu. It contains image as background, main header, 2 headers with little icons below them and couple of items with prices and footer with address and e-mail address

## 3rd day 11.05.2023

Third day and third task on fCC. This time it was all about making 3 color markers and styling them in css to look more real. Main focus in this task was on colors, how to change their properties.

## 4th day 12.05.2023

Another assignment on fCC was to make registration form. Form had to contain couple inputs such as name, e-mail, password (which had some requirements), also radio-inputs, checkbox, select and textarea.

Next task on fCC was to make survey form, this time it was without guidance. Today I made initial commit of this project with some html coded.
